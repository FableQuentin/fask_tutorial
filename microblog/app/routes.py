# Home page route
# Handles the different URLs that the application supports
# -> in Flask handlers for application routes are written as
#    Python functions called 'view functions'
# -> View functions are mapped to one (or more) URLs
# -> i.e Flask knows what to execute when the client request a given URL

# ========== INDEX ===========
# We use decorators to create an association between the URL given as argument and the function
# When a browser requests either of the two URL '/' or '/index', Flask is goinf to invoke this function
# and pass its value back to the browser

	# The operation that converts a template into a HTML page is called 'rendering'
	# It is done in Flask using the 'render_template(<filename.html>, <arg>)' function

	# Jinja substitutes {{ ... }} block with corresponding values provided in the <arg> of the function 
	return render_template('index.html', title='Home', user=user, posts=posts)

# ========== LOG IN/OUT ===========
#  - loading the page, the browser sends the GET request to receive the web page form
#  - Pressing the 'Submit' button in the form will send the POST request
@app.route('/login', methods=['GET', 'POST']) # tells Flask this view accepts GET and POST requests
def login():
	# In case the user is already logged in but try to access the login page

	# user object that represents the client of that request

		# This function will register the user as logged in and have the current_user variable to that user for any future page loaded 
		login_user(user, remember=form.remember_me.data)
		
		# get the 'next' query string argument
		# Flask provides a 'request' variable that contains all the information that the client sent with a request,
		# including request.args attribute (expose the content of the query string in a dict format)
		# This can be used with the @login_required decorator (set in routes.py) to add query string in a URL, making redirection to
		# '/login?next=/index' in stead of just '/login'
		#
		# In our case, we redirect when the URL is only 'relative' (not absolute), avoinding an attacker to insert an URL to a malicious site in the 'next' argument 
		#Â To determine if the URL is absolute or relative, it is parsed with 'urlsplit()' function and checked if the 'netloc' component is set or not.
